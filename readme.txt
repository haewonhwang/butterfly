Butterfly

My code is in src/student/Butterfly.java

My final project for CS2110, Data Structures & Object Oriented Design.
The program is written in Java, and animates a butterfly to traverse every
tile of the map that is shaped as a torus. The butterfly can only travel
to each tile exactly once in the shortest number of steps using a depth first 
algorithm. Then, the butterfly must pick up certain flowers by their aroma,
and by using Dijsktra's shortest path algorithm.
